There are several methods to implement gasless transactions, but one of the most popular is using a Gas Station Network (GSN) or similar relay service. Another approach is leveraging EIP-2771, which standardizes a way for contracts to handle meta-transactions.
Using EIP-2771 for Gasless Transactions

EIP-2771 introduces a standard for forwarding meta-transactions through a trusted forwarder, allowing contract calls to be made on behalf of users, with the gas fee being paid by the forwarder.

# Key Components

```Trusted Forwarder:``` A contract that forwards transactions to other contracts. It pays the gas fee and gets reimbursed or rewarded by the dApp or another mechanism.

 ``` Meta-Transaction Support in Contract:``` Your contract needs to be aware of the forwarder and able to handle calls from it.
